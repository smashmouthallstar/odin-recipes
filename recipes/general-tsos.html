	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<!-- I don't know how to wrap text properly at this stage yet. Here I use <br> instead.
		Maybe paragraphs will work better until I learn CSS. -->
	<ol>
		<li>Heat veg. oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan<br> to 375 degrees F</li>
		<li>Whisk egg in large mixing bowl. Add chicken, salt,<br> sugar, and pepper; mix well. Mix in cornstarch, a little<br> at a time until chicken is well coated.</li>
		<li>Working in batches, carefully drop one piece of<br> chicken at a time into the hot oil. Fry until chicken<br> turns golden brown and begins to float, about 3<br> minutes. Remove chicken to a plate and allow to<br> cool as you fry the next batch.</li>
		<li>Once all of the chicken has been fried, refry the<br> chicken, starting with the batch that was cooked<br> first. Fry each batch until chicken turns deep golden<br> brown, about 2 minutes more. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
		<li>To make the sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a wok or<br> large skillet over high heat. Stir in green onion,<br> garlic, whole chilies, and orange zest. Cook and stir<br> until garlic turns golden and childes brighten, 1 to 2<br> minutes.</li>
		<li>Add sugar, soy sauce, chicken broth, peanut oil, rice<br> vinegar, sesame oil, and ginger; bring to a boil and,<br> cook for 3 minutes. Whisk 2 teaspoons of cornstarch<br> in water until dissolved. Stir into the boiling sauce. Return to a boil and cook until the sauce thickens and is no longer cloudy from the cornstarch, about 1 minute.</li> <!-- I got lazy for the rest of this line. The <br> trick probably messes up a lot in tandem with CSS so I'll leave it for now. -->
		<li>Stir chicken into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to low and cook until chicken is heated through and has absorbed some of the sauce, about 3 minutes.</li>
